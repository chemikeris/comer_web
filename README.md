# Description

[The COMER web server](https://bioinformatics.lt/comer) is a web server for protein analysis based on the sequence alignment and homology search methods [COMER2](https://github.com/minmarg/comer2) and [COTHER](https://github.com/minmarg/cother). They exhibit sensitive, accurate, and fast homology searches.

The web server module is a web-based interface to the server. It allows running sequence profile-profile searches by COMER2 from a web browser or using the command-line API. This module depends on the [backend module](https://github.com/minmarg/comer-ws-backend) that runs all computations.
