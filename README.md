# Description

This is the repository for the COMER web server and GTalign-web.

[The COMER web server](https://bioinformatics.lt/comer) is a web server for protein analysis based on the sequence alignment and homology search methods [COMER2](https://github.com/minmarg/comer2) and [COTHER](https://github.com/minmarg/cother). They exhibit sensitive, accurate, and fast homology searches. The web server module is a web-based interface to the server. It allows running sequence profile-profile searches by COMER2 from a web browser or using the command-line API.

[GTalign-web](https://bioinformatics.lt/comer/gtalign/) is a web server implementing [GTalign](https://github.com/minmarg/gtalign_alpha), a spatial index-driven protein structure alignment and search tool.

This module depends on the corresponding [COMER web server](https://github.com/minmarg/comer-ws-backend) and [GTalign-web](https://github.com/minmarg/gtalign-web-backend) backend modules that run all computations.
