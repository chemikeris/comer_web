<h1>Help</h1>
<p>This is the help site for the COMER web server.</p>
<h2>Query input</h2>
<p>COMER web server accepts several types of <a href="{% url 'input' %}">input</a>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Single sequence input in FASTA or plain text formats;</li>
    <li>Single multiple-sequence alignment in FASTA or Stockholm formats;</li>
    <li>Multiple sequences input in FASTA format;</li>
    <li>Multiple inputs format, mixed of sequences and sequence alignments in plain text, FASTA, or Stockholm formats, separated by lines containing "//".</li>
</ul>
<p>Input is assigned automatically to one of the above types. For example, FASTA input having all sequences of the same length is considered to be a multiple sequence alingment, and if sequence lengths differ, it is further analyzed as input of multiple sequences.</p>
<p>Maximum number of input sequences/alignments/profiles is 100.</p>
